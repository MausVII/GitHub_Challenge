# GitHub_Challenge
Github is a gift from the **Machine Spirit** to steers us away from the cardinal sin

us look like computer wizards even when we don't know what we're doing. Death to GUIs.
It is cold outside; we're at 1 degree Celsius. I use celsius because I didn't go to college
to use inferior measurement systems. The cold might last a few days, but then we'll be back
to sweating temperatures in the middle of winter. I hate Texas.
